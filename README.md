## BUSINESS REQUIREMENT

The goal of this project is to analyze Shopify sales data in Power BI to uncover meaningful insights into transaction performance, customer purchasing behavior, and long-term customer value. By designing an interactive dashboard, the objective is to help stakeholders identify patterns in revenue generation, customer retention, and engagement trends to support data-driven decision-making.
